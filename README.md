# Array Polyfills

This repository contains custom implementations of commonly used JavaScript Array methods using polyfills. It's designed to complement my Medium blog post that explores how these methods work internally and how we can recreate them to support older JavaScript environments.

âœ… Covered methods:

- `Array.prototype.forEach`
- `Array.prototype.map`
- `Array.prototype.filter`
- `Array.prototype.reduce`
- `Array.prototype.find`
- `Array.prototype.findIndex`
